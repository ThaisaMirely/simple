,,namespace com.google.devtools.simple.runtime.components,,
= !AccelerometerSensor =

Sensor to measure acceleration in 3 dimensions, and also detect shaking.

==== Events ====
[ReferenceComponentAccelerometerSensor#Initialize Initialize]
         Initialization event.
[ReferenceComponentAccelerometerSensor#AccelerationChanged AccelerationChanged]
          Acceleration change event.
[ReferenceComponentAccelerometerSensor#Shaking Shaking]
          Shaking event.

==== Properties ====
[ReferenceComponentAccelerometerSensor#Available Available]
          Available property (read-only property).
[ReferenceComponentAccelerometerSensor#Enabled Enabled]
          Enabled property.
[ReferenceComponentAccelerometerSensor#XAccel XAccel]
          X acceleration property (read-only property).
[ReferenceComponentAccelerometerSensor#YAccel YAccel]
          Y acceleration property (read-only property).
[ReferenceComponentAccelerometerSensor#ZAccel ZAccel]
          Z acceleration property (read-only property).
----
=== Initialize ===

{{{
Event Initialize()
}}}

    Event raised upon component initialization.
----
=== !AccelerationChanged ===

{{{
Event AccelerationChanged(xAccel As Single, yAccel As Single, zAccel As Single)
}}}

    Event raised when the acceleration in any of the 3 dimensions changes.

    Parameters:
        xAccel - acceleration minus Gx on the x-axis<br>
        yAccel - acceleration minus Gy on the y-axis<br>
        zAccel - acceleration minus Gz on the z-axis
----
=== Shaking ===

{{{
Event Shaking()
}}}

    Event raised when the device is being shaken.
----
=== Available ===

{{{
Property Available As Boolean
}}}

    This property indicates whether the sensor is available on the device running the application.
    This property is read-only.

----
=== Enabled ===

{{{
Property Enabled As Boolean
}}}

    Reading from the Enabled property indicates whether the sensor is generating data. Writing to the Enabled property will turn sensor data generation on or off.
    Data generation is enabled by default.
----
=== XAccel ===

{{{
Property XAccel As Single
}}}

    Reading the value of this property returns the most recent x acceleration value. In order for this property to supply meaningful values, the sensor needs to be available and enabled.

    Writing to this property will accelerate the device at the given rate. Use this only in a controlled environment as sudden acceleration may cause severe injury... No, just kidding - this property is read-only.
----
=== YAccel ===

{{{
Property YAccel As Single
}}}

    Reading the value of this property returns the most recent y acceleration value. In order for this property to supply meaningful values, the sensor needs to be available and enabled. This property is read-only.
----
=== ZAccel ===

{{{
Property ZAccel As Single
}}}

    Reading the value of this property returns the most recent z acceleration value. In order for this property to supply meaningful values, the sensor needs to be available and enabled. This property is read-only.
