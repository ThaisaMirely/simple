The color value is encoded as _&Haarrggbb_ where _aa_ represents the alpha value (&H00 - transparent to &HFF - opaque), _rr_ represents the red, _gg_ the green and _bb_ the blue component of the color. Writing to the !BackgroundColor property will set the background color of the form.

     There are a number of predefined color constants: `Component.COLOR_NONE`, `Component.COLOR_BLACK`, `Component.COLOR_BLUE`, `Component.COLOR_CYAN`, `Component.COLOR_DKGRAY`, `Component.COLOR_GRAY`, `Component.COLOR_GREEN`, `Component.COLOR_LTGRAY`, `Component.COLOR_MAGENTA`, `Component.COLOR_RED`, `Component.COLOR_WHITE` and `Component.COLOR_YELLOW`.
